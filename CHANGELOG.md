## [2.0.0] — 2026-04-21 (unreleased, `feat/async-api` branch)

First public release with the Stage 3 async API. This is a breaking
release; the changes below affect compilation (C++ standard) and
ABI (abstract base classes gained async peers). Sync call sites are
preserved bit-for-bit, so **application code that doesn't override
`Provider` / `CheckpointStore` / `GraphNode` / `Tool` continues to
work unchanged**.

### Breaking

- **C++20 required.** The public API exposes `asio::awaitable<T>`
  return types that need `std::coroutine` support. Consumers must
  compile with `-std=c++20` (or higher). GCC 13+, Clang 15+ tested;
  see `docs/ASYNC_GUIDE.md` §4.1 for GCC 13 coroutine workarounds.
- **libpqxx dependency dropped.** `neograph::postgres` now links
  libpq directly. Ubuntu 24.04 users no longer hit the
  `pqxx::argument_error::argument_error(..., std::source_location)`
  link error introduced by libpqxx-7.8t64's C++17/C++20 mismatch.
  **Scheduled for Stage 3 Sem 3.3** — not yet in this branch.
- **`Provider`, `CheckpointStore`, `GraphNode`, `MCPClient` ABIs
  extended.** Each grew async peer virtual functions
  (`complete_async`, `save_async`, `execute_async`, `rpc_call_async`
  and their variants). Downstream subclasses recompile against the
  2.0 headers; source is unchanged unless the subclass wants to
  provide a native async override (recommended for any implementor
  that does real I/O).
- **`CheckpointStore::save` / `load_latest` / `load_by_id` / `list`
  / `delete_thread` are no longer pure virtual.** They now have
  default implementations that bridge to the matching `_async`
  peer via `neograph::async::run_sync`. Subclasses that override
  the sync side keep working; subclasses that didn't provide any
  override (which would have been a compile error before) now
  infinitely recurse — contract: override at least one of each
  sync/async pair.

### Added

- **Async API** across all I/O layers
  (`docs/ASYNC_GUIDE.md` for full reference):
  - `Provider::complete_async` on the base class and all built-in
    providers (OpenAI, Schema, RateLimited).
  - `MCPClient::rpc_call_async` for both HTTP and stdio
    transports. stdio uses `asio::posix::stream_descriptor`.
  - `CheckpointStore::*_async` for all eight sync methods.
  - `GraphNode::execute_async` + stream / full / full_stream
    variants, with async-native crossover defaults.
  - `GraphEngine::run_async` / `run_stream_async` / `resume_async`
    driving `execute_graph_async` — an end-to-end coroutine super-
    step loop including parallel fan-out via
    `asio::experimental::make_parallel_group`.
  - `neograph::AsyncTool` adapter for user tools that want a
    coroutine body while preserving the sync `Tool` interface.
- **`neograph::async` namespace** — HTTP client, connection pool,
  SSE parser, run_sync bridge, URL endpoint splitter. See
  `include/neograph/async/*.h`.
- **New examples**:
  - `examples/27_async_concurrent_runs.cpp` — multiple agents on
    one `io_context`.
  - `examples/05_parallel_fanout.cpp` (rewritten) — async fan-out
    within a single graph run using `run_parallel_async`.
- **CI bench regression gate** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) —
  PR checks enforce floors on `bench_async_http` / `bench_async_fanout`
  / `bench_neograph`.

### Performance

Measured on the feat/async-api branch against Stage 2 sync baselines:

- `bench_async_http --mode async_pool --concur 1000`:
  6064 ops/s → **17834 ops/s** (2.9×).
- `bench_async_fanout --concur 50000`:
  thread-per-agent unachievable → **541K ops/s / 67 MB RSS**.
- `examples/27_async_concurrent_runs` (3 × 50ms async work):
  150ms (sync) → **50ms** (1 io_context thread).
- `examples/05_parallel_fanout` (3 × 100-150ms async work):
  370ms (sequential) → **150ms** (1 io_context thread).
- `bench_neograph` engine overhead: unchanged (~30 µs seq /
  ~205 µs par). Coroutine machinery does not regress the hot path.

### Not yet in 2.0.0

- **Postgres checkpoint store** still uses libpqxx sync under the
  hood; `save_async` routes through `run_sync`. Sem 3.3 replaces
  this with a libpq pipeline-mode implementation.
- **Taskflow dependency** remains. The sync `engine.run()` path
  still uses it for fan-out; Sem 4.5 revisits whether sync paths
  can be replaced by `run_sync(*_async)` so the dependency can
  drop entirely.

### Fixed post-bump

- **`async::HttpResponse` headers map** — the response surface now
  exposes a `headers` vector of `(name, value)` pairs preserving wire
  order and original casing, plus `get_header(name)` as a
  case-insensitive accessor. Retry-After and Location remain as
  dedicated fields for backward compatibility. Unblocks the MCP
  session tracking fix below.
- **MCP `Mcp-Session-Id` header tracking** — the Sem 2.6
  httplib→async_post migration silently dropped this. Every post-
  initialize RPC now echoes the server-assigned session id back
  via the new headers accessor, so the server's session state
  stays routable.
